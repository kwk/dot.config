# Description: This script will be ran before a commit is successfully
# committed. They are python tests that makes sure that the conform to "pep8"
# and there are no compatibility issues with python 2 and 3.
#
# This script is based on the orginal script on the sos wiki, but adds support
# to running the python 3 using the "scl" python environment.
#
# Usage: This file is used by git and ran after a commit is done. It is not
# intended to be ran by user.
#
# The file should be copied to either the global hooks directory or the local
# repo directory: <local git repo>/.git/hooks/pre-commit.
#
# The script needs to have the exeute bit set, for example:
# $ chmod +x <local git repo>/.git/hooks/pre-commit
