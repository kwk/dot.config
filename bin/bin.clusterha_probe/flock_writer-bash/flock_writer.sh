# Description: This script will use `flock` to make sure that only 1 process can
# write to a file at a time which prevents corruption from occurring.

This script writes a string to a file for a set number of
iterations and uses flock to getexclusive access to the file.

OPTIONS:
   -h      Show this message
   -i      The number of iterations
   -p      Path to the file that will be written to

EXAMPLE:
$ $bname -p /mnt/gfs2/flocked-file.txt
